# Superhero Trivia Game

My Superhero Trivia Game is a fun and interactive contest consisting of questions surrounding the Superhero universe. Players can choose a randomized question and type in their answer. They have three lives and must achieve a score of 5 to win the game.

## Features

If players answer a trivia question correctly, their score will increase and if they answer a question incorrectly, they will lose a life. Players will be alerted if they answer a question correctly or incorrectly.
